# QBX-MS-Radio
Brand new design of radio script, no more big AF picture of radio, instead of a modern smooth channel list

Thd normal radio is just put a pic of a radio for UI and I think this is lame AF, so I inspired by (Stolen) origen radio design and another dev's idea to made this, say it again I made this just for own use and fun, didnt test this seriously so if problem plz submit Issue.
